**Repository Name:** Statistical Tests in Data Science

**Description:**
This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive collection of statistical tests commonly used in data science. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals of statistical analysis or an experienced data scientist aiming to refresh your knowledge, this repository offers a wide range of examples, explanations, and code snippets to help you apply various statistical tests to your data.

**Table of Contents:**

1. **Introduction to Statistical Tests:**
   - Overview of hypothesis testing
   - Types of data (categorical, numerical)
   - Types of hypotheses (null, alternative)

2. **Parametric Tests:**
   - t-tests (one-sample, independent samples, paired)
   - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
   - Linear Regression (simple, multiple)
   - Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
   - Pearson correlation
   - Parametric assumptions and diagnostics

3. **Non-Parametric Tests:**
   - Mann-Whitney U test
   - Kruskal-Wallis test
   - Wilcoxon signed-rank test
   - Spearman's rank correlation
   - Non-parametric assumptions and diagnostics

4. **Chi-Square Tests:**
   - Chi-square test for independence
   - Chi-square goodness of fit
   - Chi-square test of homogeneity
   - Cram√©r's V for effect size

5. **Resampling Methods:**
   - Bootstrapping
   - Permutation tests

6. **Advanced Techniques:**
   - Analysis of Multivariate Variance (MANOVA)
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Factor Analysis
   - Time Series Analysis (ARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition)
   - Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox Proportional Hazards)

7. **Practical Examples:**
